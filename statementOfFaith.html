          <ul>
              <h4>I. The Scriptures</h4>
              <li><p>The Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is God's revelation of Himself to man.</p></li>
              <li><p>It is a perfect treasure of divine instruction.</p></li>
              <li><p>It has God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter. Therefore, all Scripture is totally true and trustworthy.</p></li>
              <li><p>All Scripture is a testimony to Christ, who is Himself the focus of divine revelation.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <ul>
              <h4>II. God</h4>
              <li><p>There is one and only one living and true God.</p></li>
              <li><p>He is an intelligent, spiritual, and personal Being, the Creator, Redeemer, Preserver, and Ruler of the universe.</p></li>
              <li><p>God is infinite in holiness and all other perfections. God is all powerful and all knowing; and His perfect knowledge extends to all things, past, present, and future, including the future decisions of His free creatures.</p></li>
              <li><p>To Him we owe the highest love, reverence, and obedience. The eternal triune God reveals Himself to us as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence, or being.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <img style="height:50%; width:50%;" src="images/1040px-Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-English.svg.png" alt="">
          <br>
          <ul>
              <h4>III. Man</h4>
              <li><p>Man is the special creation of God, made in His own image.</p></li>
              <li><p>He created them male and female as the crowning work of His creation. The gift of gender is thus part of the goodness of God's creation. In the beginning man was innocent of sin and was endowed by his Creator with freedom of choice.</p></li>
              <li><p>By his free choice man sinned against God and brought sin into the human race. Through the temptation of Satan man transgressed the command of God, and fell from his original innocence whereby his posterity inherit a nature and an environment inclined toward sin. Therefore, as soon as they are capable of moral action, they become transgressors and are under condemnation.</p></li>
              <li><p>Only the grace of God can bring man into His holy fellowship and enable man to fulfill the creative purpose of God. The sacredness of human personality is evident in that God created man in His own image, and in that Christ died for man; therefore, every person of every race possesses full dignity and is worthy of respect and Christian love.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <ul>
              <h4>IV. Salvation</h4>
              <li><p>Salvation involves the redemption of the whole man, and is offered freely to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, who by His own blood obtained eternal redemption for the believer. In its broadest sense salvation includes regeneration, justification, sanctification, and glorification. There is no salvation apart from personal faith in Jesus Christ as Lord.</p></li>

                    <p class="card-text">Regeneration, or the new birth, is a work of God's grace whereby believers become new creatures in Christ Jesus. It is a change of heart wrought by the Holy Spirit through conviction of sin, to which the sinner responds in repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Repentance and faith are inseparable experiences of grace. Repentance is a genuine turning from sin toward God. Faith is the acceptance of Jesus Christ and commitment of the entire personality to Him as Lord and Saviour.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Justification is God's gracious and full acquittal upon principles of His righteousness of all sinners who repent and believe in Christ. Justification brings the believer unto a relationship of peace and favor with God.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Sanctification is the experience, beginning in regeneration, by which the believer is set apart to God's purposes, and is enabled to progress toward moral and spiritual maturity through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in him. Growth in grace should continue throughout the regenerate person's life.</p>

                <h4>V. God's Purpose of Grace</h4>
                <li><p>Election is the gracious purpose of God, according to which He regenerates, justifies, sanctifies, and glorifies sinners. It is consistent with the free agency of man, and comprehends all the means in connection with the end. </p></li>
                <li><p>It is the glorious display of God's sovereign goodness, and is infinitely wise, holy, and unchangeable. It excludes boasting and promotes humility.</p></li>
                <li><p>All true believers endure to the end. Those whom God has accepted in Christ, and sanctified by His Spirit, will never fall away from the state of grace, but shall persevere to the end.</p></li>
                <li><p>Believers may fall into sin through neglect and temptation, whereby they grieve the Spirit, impair their graces and comforts, and bring reproach on the cause of Christ and temporal judgments on themselves; yet they shall be kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.</p></li>
